IS-Project

1. To run this project first clone the repository. 
2. Then install the python libraries using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
3. Run the command 'python run.py'. If any error arises it may be due to the absence of some libraries (although all of them are included in the requirements.txt file)
4. Now register a user with username 'admin' (other entries as per choice). Now register a test user. 
5. Send a png image to the other users while logged in as admin. Now logout and open as test user and code sent will run. 

Note: At present this code is tested for small commands like 'alert("Hello");', 'console.log("Hello")'; 'console.log(new Date())'; 'var a = 5; for(let i = 0; i < a; i++) {console.log("hello");}'. Minor modifications to the source code (bit of formatting for JSON data parsing and in HTML files) can help including external scripts and even running bigger scripts on the client side.
